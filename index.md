## CS50’s Introduction to Programming - Building From Scratch, Project 9

This is CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Scratch The Lecture 1 **Unnoficial** Video Player On Scratch. This project is a **MASSIVE FILE** and Scratch does not like files this size because it wouldn't save for me and the sb3 is around 90 mb which is pretty big. The maximum is 50 mb. It is because of the 3500+ _low quality_ images that i have to use as frames because scratch does not support mp4 files.

### The Requirements

This is what the requirements for Project 9 are. 
- At least three different sprites.
- At least three total backdrops.
- At least one broadcast.
- At least one clone.
- At least one custom block.
- At least one variable.
- At least one loop.
- At least one condition.
- At least one event.

### How I Met The Requirements

I met the first requirement by having multiple controls for the video(Play,Pause, etc).

The second requirement is met by having different colours that are changable by clicking on a different coloured sprite next to the video control.

The third requirement of having one brodcast are shown with the video controls talking with the video itself(_The video is playing with the 3500+ images going next frame at 15 fps with audio playing simotaniously in one sprite_).

There were 10 clones for the mini game hence, I met the third requirement

There were custom blocks to pause and unpause the video as Scratch 3.0 does not nativly support pausing and unpausing video meeting the 5th requirent.

The sixth requirement is to have at least one variable which is used in an accesibility feature by displaying the name of the color of the background.

The seventh requirement is to have at least one loop and that is met by going through frames of the costumes on the sprite.

The eighth reqirement is to have one condition and that is used with having the play and pause buttons turn grey when the mouse hovers over it.

The ninth and final requirement is by having at least one event which there are twenty events in the project.

### How To Run

I HIGHLY suggest that you use turbowarp after downloading the sb3 file from the google drive link in README.md because turbowarp can apperently handle the outragous file size.

1. Go to README.MD
2. Click the Google Drive link there
3. Download the .sb3 file and it should be around 90 mb
4. Go to Turbowarp it will also be in README.md file and 
5. Go to file
6. Go to load from computer
7. upload "FINAL PROJECT CS50S.sb3"
8. Wait for it to load
9. Press the green flag
10. Press the on button in the bottom right hand corner and your done!

### Extras

I want to thank the **AMAZING** people at turbowarp. I could not have done this without it. I want to also give credit to the scratch wiki for helping with the audio pause and unpause. And I want to thank the absolute **GENIUSES** at github which has helped me time and time again. And I want to thank the CS50 Team and Brian Yu for an amazing course. That was my final project.
